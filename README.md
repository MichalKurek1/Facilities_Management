# Facilities Management

The project goal is to optimize employee time management for a sport centers owner. The need for a custom solution is due to large number of young employees with irregular availability in several facilities.

# Functionality

The application has 3 user roles: 
- employee (can enter daily availability for every week, check personal and facility schedule)
- manager (can creat weekly schedule using sliders based on availability given by employees from assigned facility, can generate the monthly salary based on hours from schedule and hourly rate, can add new employees for assigned facility) 
- admin/owner (can sees all avaiable information, can manage user roles and acces for the application)

# Technologies

It was created in Spring Boot. User role management and user authorization was created using Spring Security. The fron-end part was created based on Bootstrap and JS.  

The project is still in progress. The next step is to add additional functionalities (ex. event management) and to upgrade front-end.
